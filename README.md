## Portfolio Project 3

Built with Python and deployed on Heroku, this is a terminal-based version of the popular word guessing game, Hangman. The user must guess each letter of a randomly generated, secret word. The user is represented by a stick figure, to be hung from a gallows. They have six lives with which to win the game. If they guess a letter that is not contained in the secret word, then they lose a life and the hangman draws a part of the users body on the noose.

### Purpose

<br> 

## User Experience Design

### Strategy 

#### User Stories

* As a visitor I want to:
    * Intuatively know what the application is for.

* As a first-time user I want to:
    * Know the rules of the game.
    * Know how to start the game.
 
* As a user I want to:
    * Know the result of the game.
    * Choose to play again if I want to.

#### Developer Stories

* As a website developer I want to:
    * Create an application that is intuative.
    * Make a game that is enjoyable.
    * Make a game that is replayable.

#### Surface
The idea behind the aesthetic of the website is to convey friendliness, a sense of adventure, and a connection with nature in modern times.

### Feedback

### Features Left to Implement 
* Seperate pages for the most significant parts of the park which describes them in further detail.
* Maps of park trails that visitors can take whe they get there. 

## Technologies Used

* The project was written with Python.
* The project was deployed on Heroku.
* The project used Code Institute's [Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) 
* Github was used for hosting, utilising git version control, and for hosting the site on GitHub pages.
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) was used to write and test the code. 

* **Testing tools are credited and mentioned in the next section**

## Testing

The game was deployed and the code was tested using PEP8

### Validator Testing


#### Lighthouse â€” Dev Tools

* I used Lighthouse to test my sites accessability and it received a very good score on desktop and mobile.

* While accessability on mobile was great, performance could improve. After a look through the details, I realised that two of the images could be reduced in size. I will implement this at a later date as it's not inside the scope of this particular project.

 #### WAVE

 * I also tested the site with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and found some accessibility alerts which I easilly fixed.
